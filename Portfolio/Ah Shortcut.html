            <p>Date: February - April 2021 <br> Project Type: Group (3) <br> Role: Routing system & AR functionality</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This was a project for the course Software in the final year of my bachelor at Industrial Design Engineering. The goal of the course was to teach the basics of software development and not necessarily UX/UI design. For the course an app was used as a basis around which the basics of software development was explained. The course had a final project in which you worked in a group of three and designed / programmed your own app in java and XML using Android studio as the IDE.</p>
            <p>AH Shortcut is an android app that helps shoppers create a shopping list and find the most optimal route through the supermarket, getting from Appels to Bananas the most optimal way. I was in charge of implement an algorithm that calculates the optimal route using real time location data. I also added an augmented reality feature as an extra assignment for the honours programme. The augmented reality feature shows an arrow directing the user to the location of their groceries instead of the top down view of the map.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>It wasn't important to create a new or perfect app but the goals was to learn the basics of software development. Thus we choose to work on a app that would help shoppers navigate supermarkets. We started off with ideating the flow of the app which resulted in the final flow design below. After which a basic plan was created and the group split to work on our own parts, daily meetings were used to integrate and test the app. One group member worked on the overall GUI elements and design, one member worked on the shopping cart and the last member (me) worked on the routing and AR functionality.</p>

            <h4>Many Apps, Bugs and Crashes</h4>
            <p>I have always liked to code because I see at as a puzzle that can be solved. But during this project I quickly realised that coding isn't always as fun as I had though before. The amount of bugs I would come across in a day, which often were just stupid spelling mistakes, or the difficulty that creating the fastest route between point is (Travelling salesman problem). I quickly found out that for me creating many in between apps and test points worked the best for solving my first problem. Wanting to have an AR compass, that can be multiple apps. An AR testing app (the duck below), a compass app, and then the combined AR and compass app. But even the last step took many iterations. The second problem was way harder to solve and in the end the route to only one product could be calculated using an A* algorithm. Tackling the traveling salesman problem was way outside the scope of this course and even my design studies.</p>
