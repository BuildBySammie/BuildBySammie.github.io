            <p>Date: November 2019 - March 2020 <br> Project Type: Group (5) <br> Role: Phisycal Design and Prototype</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This was an inter faculty honours project. The main goal of the project was to better learn how to design for people who are visually impaired. The project was hands on where we learned by doing.</p>
            <p>The final result was an oven designed with visual impairment in mind. The inputs are fully tactile indicating their functions using braille and having really distinct notches that makes the user sure that they have selected a different setting. An extra audio button can be pressed so the user can check their settings and be sure that they have selected the right ones. The oven also has a light button that turns on or off the integrated light and screen, which is often not needed but can be useful when guest are over.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The goal of the project was to create a design that you could improve or help in the life of a visually impaired person. In the early research stages we found that cooking is often an chore that can be difficult. And this difficulty only increases when appliances aren't designed with a visual impairment in mind.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>The research started with two experiences with the goal to better empathize with visual impaired people. The first experience was at Muziem. Here we had multiple dark experiences, where we had to walk in a truly black room (I tried making a picture but as you can see it was rather dark). I for the first time truly experience what it felt to have to function while you can't even see your own nose. The second experience was at an art centrum with art specially made for the visual impaired. You could touch all the art pieces which was really interesting, it created an new tactile layer that I hadn't experienced before. It inspired me to see the tactile experience in another light.</p>

            <img src="img/Oculus Oven/tactile experience.png" alt="">
            <p>With these experiences in mind we started to research our area of cooking. We quickly realised that most products on the market are solutions to physical problems, like cutting food or measuring amounts. But there were almost no electric appliances specially tailored to them. Thus we concluded that designing an electric appliance would be the best way to improve their life.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Ideating</h4>
            <p>During the ideating phase we quickly realised that an specially designed oven would be a great product to have for a visually impaired person. Current ovens are always designed with visual feedback, having a screen or using icons on buttons. And modern knobs often have a smooth turning feel with no tactile feedback. So how can they know what settings they have selected. This often translated in them only using a couple of settings that they themselves have indicated using special stickers.</p>
            <p>In our opinion the best solution would be two fold, first have a physical oven that is specially designed and secondly have an app so the user can use their phone to control the oven. After having designed our overall concept we split into three groups. One group worked on the app (two persons), one group worked on the physical prototype (me) and the last group worked on a server so the app could talk to the physical prototype (two persons).</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Physical Design</h4>
            <p>The controls of the oven are specially tailored to visually impaired people. This is done by simplifying the usual plethora of functions and buttons to 4 buttons that are used to operate the oven and two extra buttons that can be used as back up. The buttons are all made with tactile feedback in mind. They have their settings indicated with extrusions on the top following the Braille guide lines so they can be understood easily with your fingertips. And when turning a knob the ridges are large enough to be noticable even with gloves on. So the user can be sure they changed a setting.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h4>Physical Prototype</h4>
            <p>An 3D printed prototype was made to show case the design of the inputs. It also made it possible to test with someone who visual impaired. Their input helped creating a better product because although they were really fond of the idea there were some small tweaks needed to the tactile features on the buttons. Next to the inputs of the oven the electronics were also prototyped using Arduino and were integrated with the app and server.</p>
