            <h2>Braun Exo Cooker</h2>

            <p>Date: September 2021 - January 2022 <br> Project Type: Individual</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This project was during the Advanced Concept Design course of the master Integrated Product Design at the Industrial Design and Engineering faculty of the TU Delft. The goal of the course was to create an advanced concept design, from a design brief given by a client. The client I worked for was De' Longhi Braun Household which was an incredible opportunity to learn and work together with their design director.</p>
            <p>The design brief was very open but the main hope was for Braun to have a concept that could improve the life of people living in tiny houses. My goal was to focus on the cooking experience in a tiny home and improve this often neglected pain point. The Braun Exo Cooker is a rugged cooking solution designed for the off the gird tiny home that currently uses wood stoves. It uses a combination of electric heating and exothermic heating to provide a cooking solution for the entire year.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <img src="img/Exo Cooker/the proces.JPG" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>Tiny Homes?</h4>
            <p>Research into tiny homes was started as groups where we went to multiple tiny house communities. Here we got tours of the owners and could anything about how their life in a tiny home was. Something I noticed was that although they compromise on a lot to live their lifestyle they often not necessarily lack any comfort. But there are a lot of gradations within the tiny house lifestyle and I found that the off the grid lifestyles fitted the most with the direction Braun wanted to go. So an attribute map was used to create an conversable mental model.</p>
            <img src="img/Exo Cooker/atribute cardd2.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>Sketching is as prevalent in design as something could be and of course I don't shy away from it. I often prefer sketching as a tool to ideate quickly by sketching small ideas or design directions.</p>
            <img src="img/Exo Cooker/sketches.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>Design directions</h4>
            <p>I had found three design directions that I could use as a starting point. Using pressure created by the user, using an exothermic reaction and an energy management system. The pressure direction uses the same principle as a piston fire starter, but this direction was quickly found to be non-desirable because of the amount of effort it would require of the user. The energy management direction found the same fate because it only mitigates the problem and doesn't solve it. And thus the exothermic reaction was used as a basis for further ideas.</p>
            <img src="img/Exo Cooker/first design directions.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>From the basis of an exothermic reaction multiple ideas where sketched but three concepts were considered viable. A kettle, a home coffee brewing station and an outdoor cooking system.  The outdoor cooking system was chosen as the best option to use for future steps because of its versatility over the other concepts and that it can solve the problem of seasonal energy dependency</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Research never stops</h4>
            <p>I am often really fond of research because it means that you can learn something new. And this project was full with research opportunities. For example the design direction uses an exothermic reaction to heat food. This chemical reaction creates hydrogen gas, but how much? and how much is even allowed. For me it meant that I could dust off my high school chemistry knowledge and getting lost in papers or data sources about the safety of hydrogen.</p>
            <img src="img/Exo Cooker/gas calculations.JPG" alt="">
            <p>An part of the course was to set up an test where two different solutions could be compared. My curiosity was sparked by the fact that there probably is a most efficient pan shape. If it is only heated from the bottom then all the other sides will radiate heat out and thus decrease efficiency. My test was thus setup to compare different pans and look if this was the case. I made an Arduino data logger to accomplish this goal. It would measure the temperature every couple of seconds from which the efficiency per pan could be calculated.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Finaly a direction</h4>
            <p>After many weeks of research and ideation I had finally gotten to the point where I had a direction for a concept beneficial for both Braun and tiny house inhabitants. It uses both the exothermic reaction and a solar powered battery. I was finally able to make an about one to one scale model and perform user tests. After which I went into Solidworks to create the final design.</p>

            <h4>Parts</h4>
            <p>
                The Braun Exo Cooker consist out of five parts:
                <br><br>
                <b>The lid: </b>The lid can be closed airtight and be kept under pressure using four locking clips. It has three additions to increase user satisfaction and safety. A glass window so the user can see their food, A temperature and pressure sensor / dial that shows the current conditions in the pan.
                <br><br>
                <b>The Pan: </b>The cooking pan is the perfect size for a two person meal (1.6L). This way no unnecessary space gest used and no unnecessary food gets heated up. To increase the efficiency of the pan two improvements are used, an insulated double wall and a copper core for better heat conduction.
                <br><br>
                <b>Electric heater: </b>The electric heater uses a 1000W conduction coil to heat up the pan. The heater has 5 power modes with which the user can play to get the perfect energy output for their cooking needs.
                <br><br>
                <b>Battery pack: </b>There battery pack can store 470 WH with which it can boil the contents of the pan and then keep it at a boiling temperature for 20 minutes. The battery also has five leds to indicate the energy level of the battery.
                <br><br>
                <b>Exothermic heater: </b>The exothermic heater uses a non-reusable 60 gram packet with which it can heat up food to around boiling point. The exothermic reaction last for about 10 to 20 minutes but because of the insulation of the pan it can capture and retain this heat for much longer.
            </p>

            <h4>Principles</h4>
            <p>
                The Braun Exo Cooker uses four principles to improve the efficiency and thus improve the usability for an off the grid tiny home:
                <br><br>
                <b>Size and shape: </b>The internal volume of the pan is 1.6 litres. This size is a specially designed for a two person meal. Because efficiency is an important objective you do not want to heat unnecessary food. And the shape is optimised to have the smallest area exposed to heat. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Heat transfer: </b>By using a multi material design the benefits of the materials can be utilised. Copper for better heat conductivity and stainless for a better cooking experience.
                <br><br>
                <b>Insulation: </b>Normal cooking pans are always thin walled, this stems from costs and cooking with gas. The concept uses an electric induction coil to heat up the pan, thus a thin wall isn't necessary because the heat gets directly put into the bottom of the pan. Thus an insulated layer can be added to improve efficiency.
                <br><br>
                <b>Pressure : </b>Special seals create an airtight volume that together with the four clips makes it possible to use the Exo Cooker at a higher pressure. This is beneficial for cooking efficiency, it kills more bacteria and food retains more vitamins and nutrients.
