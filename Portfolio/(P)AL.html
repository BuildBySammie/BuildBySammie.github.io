            <p>Date: January - July 2022 <br> Project Type: Group (5) <br> Role: Electronics and Embedded software Design & Final Prototype integration</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This project was during the Advanced Embodiment Design course of the master Integrated Product Design at the Industrial Design and Engineering faculty of the TU Delft. The goal of the course was to go through an embodiment design phase for a client. Our group worked for Limagrain a company specialised in seed production.</p>
            <p>The problem Limagrain coped with was that their sampling technique, to test seed viability, was done fully manual and took a lot of effort. They sample the leaf's of young plants to determine if the specific seed is worth to keep growing. Our final design was a two part system, one handheld device (leaf sampler) and one belt suspended part (deep well plate holder). The system could track any sample and their location in a deep well plate making errors a thing of the past.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <h4>Company visit</h4>
            <p>A good design process should always have an close collaboration with the user of the product and our process for Limagrain wasn't any different. We started early on with a company visit to the green houses so we could experience first-hand how the leaf sampling process is.</p>
            <img src="img/(P)AL/company visit.png" alt="">
            <br><br>
            <h4>Ideation and prototypes</h4>
            <p>We quickly started ideating on possible solutions after the first company visit. We started quickly with physical protypes to test if certain solutions would work. This for me meant that I could get my Lego box and try to figure out how certain mechanical systems could work. But of course not everything is testable using Lego and thus some small 3D prints were made. I also worked on digital prototypes next to the physical ones. This way we could simulate a possible solution if the parts were to intricate to create prototypes for.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h4>Design directions</h4>
            <p> We had our final plan / solution around the midterm of the project after which we could fully focus on creating the final product. We found that using two separate parts one for the leaf sampling and one to hold the deep well plate would improve usability and comfort. This way we could separate the heavy parts from the handheld device making it function as a input and output device. The heavy stuff like the battery and deep well plate could then be hanged on a belt giving the person full range of motion while not having to drag a cart around. This was also the moment when the roles where divided. Other group members wanted to improve their own prototyping skills and would thus focus more the physical design. This wasn't a problem for me because although prototyping is my strength I also feel at home working with electronics and writing code. But in the end I could also give my finishing touch on the final deep well plate holder because I had the most experience with creating nice looking prototypes and tools that I could use at home</p>

            <h4>Electronics and software design</h4>
            <p>I have always played with electronics and felt right at home working with them during this project. I would research parts and test them trying to find out what the best solution would be. From the requirements it also became apparent that an Arduino wouldn't fit the client's needs. We found that a raspberry pi would be a great replacement. Although I hadn't worked with them before it was a great moment to learn how to work with Linux and learn how to write python scripts.</p>
            <img src="img/(P)AL/coding big screen.png" alt="">
            <p>You haven't lived until you have written code 10 cm away from a giant screen. <br> And when you have something working it creates the best feeling in the world.</p>

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>Prototyping for the electronics and embedded software was really fun, but it was also a challenge to figure out why something wouldn't work. Because I worked on them at the same time it was often more about figuring out which of the two parts was broken than figuring out why it was broken. But nevertheless I would always persevere over my own mistakes and have a working prototype in the end.</p>
            <img src="img/(P)AL/Picture4.png" alt="">
            <br><br>
            <p>But how fun prototyping is there is always something that can go wrong. This project wasn't any different. The first big problem was a design mistake in the handheld device. It would put pressure on the SD card of the raspberry pi (which holds everything it needs to run). This inevitably broke the SD card creating a fun couple of hours for me to try and figure out why nothing worked anymore.</p>
            <img src="img/(P)AL/stuff goes wrong.png" alt="">
            <br><br>
            <p>I also worked on physical prototypes, I worked on the deep well plate holder which was a nice change of scenery. I Also finalised the belt system and of course had to test if everything was working. </p>

            <br><br>
            <h4>Final Prototype</h4>
            <p>Creating the final prototype was a big sprint, although we had something that worked we didn't have something that looked nice. And the task was given to me to make this discrepancy right. It started of with something that would be good enough to test with but we had a client meeting and nothing makes a client happier than something that looks good. Thus I gathered my tools and went to work. I always love this part of creating protypes, the main design is finished and I can just do my thing getting lost in the flow of building.</p>
