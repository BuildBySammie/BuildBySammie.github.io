            <h2>XT Driver</h2>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/XT_driver.jpg" alt="Screw dirver">
            <p>Date: September - November 2020 <br> Project Type: Individual</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This was a project during my minor in Advacend Prototyping. In the course students were though how to use Advacned Prototyping techniques like laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D scanning, among other things. Students where then asked to use this new knowlegde in design project.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/Advacned package.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The XT driver is a bit driver designed to have as much torque as possible while fitting comfortable in your hand. It consist out of a perfect fitting handle with a high torque operation or a high speed operation. Which can easily be changed using the tapered head and magnetic  retention system. The handle is created using a 3d scanned model that perfeclty fits in our hand after wich it is automaticly procesed into a handle using Rhino and Grashopper. After which the final design was 3D printed.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The goal of the project was to create a design that you could improve or help in your daily life using the new techniques learned during the course. I quickly realised that I could finaly improve on a pet peve i had with bit drivers. I always had the problem that they never were what i wanted and thus for this porject i embarcked on a journey to create, in my eyes, the perfect bit driver</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Research & Ideation</h4>
            <p>As any design project I started with researching bit driverers and figuring out why they didn't work for me. I quickly realised that it was two fold. The first problem was that the handle never really fitted nicely in my hand and the second was that ther always was a compromise between torque and profile. A smaller profile handle ment you could get in tighter places but had less torque and vice versa.</p>
            <p></p>
            <br>
            <h4>3D Scanning</h4>
            <p>3D scanning was one of the techniques we had learned during the course. And it was a great fit to get to handle made from clay into the digital world. To do this a technique called photogametry was used, where many foto's of an object are translated into a mesh using identifying marks on the object to link the pictures in 3D space.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/3d scanning.png" alt="">
            <p>Afer the scann was made and had been translated into a mesh the next step was to clean up the mesh to have a good starting point for any further steps. This cleaning was done in MeshLab folloiwng four steps. Left is the original and on the right the final result can be seen.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/scan clean up.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>Processing</h4>
            <p>With a clean scan in hand it was time to create the final model that than could be used to fabricate the bit driver. One of the goals of the course was to teach automated ways of translating 3D scans into useable prototypes, thus for this step Rhino and Grasphopper were used. This way the entire transltion step from mesh to bit driver could by automated.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Fabrication</h4>
            <p>The last step was to fabricate the final prototype and create a packe for it.</p>
