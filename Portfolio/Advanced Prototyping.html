            <h2>XT Driver</h2>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/XT_driver.jpg" alt="Screw dirver">
            <p>Date: September - November 2020 <br> Project Type: Individual</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This was a project during my minor in Advanced Prototyping. In the course students were though how to use Advanced Prototyping techniques like laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D scanning, among other things. Students where then asked to use this new knowledge in design project.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/Advacned package.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The XT driver is a bit driver designed to have as much torque as possible while fitting comfortable in your hand. It consist out of a perfect fitting handle with a high torque operation or a high speed operation. Which can easily be changed using the tapered head and magnetic  retention system. The handle is created using a 3d scanned model that perfectly fits in our hand after which it is automatically processed into a handle using Rhino and Grasshopper. After which the final design was 3D printed.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The goal of the project was to create a design that you could improve or help in your daily life using the new techniques learned during the course. I quickly realised that I could finally improve on a pet peeve I had with bit drivers. I always had the problem that they never were what I wanted and thus for this project I embarked on a journey to create, in my eyes, the perfect bit driver.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Research & Ideation</h4>
            <p>As any design project I started with researching and disassembling bit drivers trying to figure out why they didn't work for me. I quickly realised that it was twofold. The first problem was that the handle never really fitted nicely in my hand and the second was that there always was a compromise between torque and profile. A smaller profile handle meant you could get in tighter places but had less torque and vice versa.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/disasembly.png" alt="">
            <p>I tried to solve the first problem by creating many different handle shapes out of clay, foam, PLA and any other material I could get my hands on. But I quickly realised that a clay model perfectly fitted to my hand would work really well.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/Ideating.png" alt="">
            <p>But the design still compromised om the amount of torque it could deliver. But by trying out different angles I realised that it would be difficult to have both torque and a low profile. In the end I settle on a solution in which the head of the bit driver could rotate creating a larger lever and thus increasing the torque. But which could rotating back to a straight line to reduce the foot print when needed.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>3D Scanning</h4>
            <p>3D scanning was one of the techniques we had learned during the course. And it was a great fit to get to handle made from clay into the digital world. To do this a technique called photogrammetry was used, where many photos of an object are translated into a mesh using identifying marks on the object to link the pictures in 3D space.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/3d scanning.png" alt="">
            <p>After the scan was made and had been translated into a mesh the next step was to clean up the mesh to have a good starting point for any further steps. This cleaning was done in MeshLab following four steps. Left is the original and on the right the final result can be seen.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/scan clean up.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>Processing</h4>
            <p>With a clean scan in hand it was time to create the final model that than could be used to fabricate the bit driver. One of the goals of the course was to teach automated ways of translating 3D scans into useable prototypes, thus for this step Rhino and Grasshopper were used. This way the entire translation step from mesh to bit driver could by automated.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/Processing steps.PNG" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>Fabrication</h4>
            <p>The last step was to fabricate the final prototype and create a box for it. 3D printing was a great fit for the organic shape of the handle. And the simple colour scheme of the design made it easy to print. The box was laser cut and glued together with added foam to protect the bit driver. The box locked using strong magnets which created an almost seamless outside look for the box.</p>

            <h2>Repair4All</h2>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/Repair4all banner.jpg" alt="Senseo coffee machine with 3D printed replacement parts">
            <p>Date: November 2020 - Januari 2021 <br> Project Type: Group (5) <br> Role: Part Modeling</p>
            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>This project was also during the minor in Advanced Prototyping only this time we weren't designing for our self but we working for a client. Our client, Repair4All, had a research project running in one of the labs of the faculty Industrial Design Engineering. Where they did research into 3D printing spare parts for high function plastic parts. The goal was to find out how this could be done efficiently and effectively. Our part was to design and print as many replacement parts as we could for a product, a Senseo coffee machine. And by doing this figure out what the best way was to do so.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Our first step was to better understand the coffee machine. We did this by disassembling it and itemizing all the parts (for which I made an excel database). In this database we noted everything down from disassembly steps, size, material to manufacturing process.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/parts.png" alt="">
            <p>The next step was to recreate the parts of the coffee machine making sure that any redesign of the part would fit the every original part it contacted with and would be designed to be easily 3D printable. We choose to use Fusion360 as our modelling software because it had a nice tool for working together and we all wanted to learn something new next to Solid works.</p>
            <h4>My first part</h4>
            <p>We all wanted to have a quick and easy start, so we discussed to all start of with a simple part. My first part was the rubber pump mount. Although it looked simple at first it took me quite some iterations to get right. The difficulty was that the replacement part had to mimic the dampening effect of rubber while being made from plastic. And it connects to the bottom shell using snap fits. Creating the need for multiple printing directions in one single part.</p>

            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/pump mount iterations.jpg" alt="">
            <h4>A big endeavour</h4>
            <p>After having done some small designs I took it upon myself to try and recreate / redesign the head of the coffee machine. Which quickly proved to be difficult.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/senseo maaachine.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>I had to employ multiple techniques to be able to create parts that would fit on the original parts while at the same time being easily 3D printed. I started by testing individual subsets of a single part, to try and get the fitment right. After which these parts could be combined to create a final model in which their combined 3D location would be tested.</p>
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/subsets of parts.png" alt="">
            <img src="img/Advacned Prototyping/3D fitment.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The final step was then to improve the design for 3D printing. The for example the head shell has dome shape, and when one wants this side to look nice it would have to printed pointing up. But this drastically increases printing time. By redesigning the head to be flat it can be printed more easily and faster.</p>
